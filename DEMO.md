The invitation. What's changing in software engineering. Why it matters. Philosophical.

This document. Evidence the process works. Meta.

None were planned. All emerged.

## Try It Yourself

The process:

1. Enter with no goal. Or a vague one.
2. Let the agent generate.
3. Reject fast. "Not interesting." "Wrong direction." "Closer."
4. Don't explain. Just signal.
5. Watch what happens when easy answers fail.
6. Notice what emerges from the friction.
7. Capture what crystallizes.

The requirements:

- Tacit knowledge worth extracting
- Trust in your own gut
- Willingness to reject without guilt
- Tolerance for goallessness
- Time (hours, not minutes)

What you might find:

- Knowledge you had but couldn't articulate
- Edges of the agent's capabilities
- Your own patterns made visible
- Novel formulations neither party brought
- Something unexpected

## Final Note

This document is proof of concept.

Not proof that everyone should do this. Not proof that this is the best way. Just proof that something happened here. That sustained goalless friction between human and agent produced artifacts that didn't exist before.

The frontier is created by those who walk there.

This is one footprint.

Make your own.
