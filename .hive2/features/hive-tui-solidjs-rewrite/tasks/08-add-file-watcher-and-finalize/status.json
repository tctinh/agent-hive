  "summary": "Added chokidar-based file watcher hook (useHiveWatcher) that monitors .hive/features/<feature> for changes and auto-refreshes Dashboard and PlanViewer. Fixed type errors: instantiated FeatureService/TaskService/PlanService correctly, changed backgroundColor to bg, used evt.raw for keyboard input, and applied bg+fg for selection highlighting. Added readSpec() method to TaskService. Build: 26.25 KB (passed typecheck).",
