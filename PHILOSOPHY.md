## Why "Hive"? The Inspiration

### Nature's Most Efficient System
Bees aren't just insects — they're the world's most efficient distributed workforce. A single hive coordinates thousands of workers without central micromanagement, produces consistent output, and leaves behind a perfect record of their work.
**The honeycomb is nature's most efficient structure.** Mathematicians proved it: hexagonal cells use the least material to create the most storage space. No wasted effort. No wasted space. Maximum output from minimum input.
This is exactly what we want from AI agents:
| Bee Colony | Agent Hive |
|------------|------------|
| Queen coordinates, doesn't micromanage | Planner orchestrates, workers execute autonomously |
| Each worker knows their role | Each task agent has clear spec.md instructions |
| Honeycomb stores everything efficiently | `.hive/` structure organizes all artifacts |
| Waggle dance communicates plans | Plan → Review → Approve workflow |
| Royal jelly nourishes development | Context files ground agents in reality |
| Honey is the valuable output | Documentation emerges naturally from work |
| Propolis seals and protects | TDD verification ensures quality |
### The Parallel is Intentional
A beehive solves the exact problems we face with AI agents:
- **Coordination without chaos** — Thousands of bees, zero conflicts
- **Distributed execution** — Workers operate independently but toward shared goals
- **Persistent memory** — The hive structure itself encodes knowledge
- **Quality assurance** — Bees inspect cells before sealing
- **Traceability** — Every cell, every drop of honey, accounted for
When we designed Agent Hive, we asked: *"What if AI agents could work like a bee colony?"*
The answer became this platform.

## Hive Terminology

| Term | Role | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Beekeeper** | You | The human operator. Observes, steers, approves. Doesn't do the work — manages the hive. |
| **Hive** | Platform | The Agent Hive platform itself. The structured workspace where agents operate. |
| **Architect Bee** | Planner | Plans features, interviews you, writes plan.md. NEVER executes or delegates. |
| **Swarm Bee** | Orchestrator | Coordinates execution, delegates to workers, merges results. The Hive Queen. |
| **Scout Bee** | Researcher | Researches codebase and external docs in parallel. Uses MCP tools. |
| **Forager Bee** | Executor | Executes tasks in isolated worktrees. Does the actual coding. |
| **Hygienic Bee** | Reviewer | Reviews plan documentation quality. Returns OKAY/REJECT verdict. |
| **Nest** | Feature | A feature. Self-contained with its own plan, context, and tasks. (`.hive/features/<name>/`) |
| **Comb** | Task Structure | The organized grid of cells (tasks) within a nest. The work breakdown structure. |
| **Cells** | Tasks | Individual tasks within a comb. Each cell is isolated (worktree) and produces one unit of work. |
| **Royal Jelly** | Context | Context files that nourish workers — research, decisions, references. Without it, workers hallucinate. |
| **Honey** | Artifacts | The output — `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `report.md`, code. Persistent documentation that emerges from work. |
| **Propolis** | Verification | TDD subtasks that seal work as complete. Tests prove the cell is solid. |
| **Waggle Dance** | Planning | The planning phase. Architect communicates, Beekeeper reviews, alignment before action. |
| **Swarming** | Parallelism | Batched parallel execution. Multiple Foragers dispatched simultaneously to their cells. |
| **Hiving** | Working | The act of using the Hive platform. *"Stop vibing. Start hiving."* |

### The Efficiency Promise
Just as a beehive achieves remarkable output through structure, not chaos:
> **Every worker, every cell, every drop of honey — tracked.**
The Hive platform doesn't slow agents down. It channels their energy into **hexagonal efficiency**: maximum output, minimum waste, perfect traceability.

## Built on Battle-Tested Principles

Hive's design is grounded in proven practices from the AI coding community, particularly [Boris Cherny's 13 Pro Tips for Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-code-best-practices).

| Boris's Tip | Hive Implementation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Tip 4: Team CLAUDE.md** | Context persists per-feature in `.hive/context/` |
| **Tip 6: Start in Plan mode** | Plan → Approve → Execute workflow |
| **Tip 8: Leverage subagents** | Batched parallelism with worktree isolation |
| **Tip 13: Give feedback loops** | TDD subtasks — tests define done |

> *"Give Claude a way to verify its work. When Claude has a feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result."* — Boris Cherny

## Why Hive Exists

Vibe coding is powerful but chaotic. We identified 6 pain points:

| # | Pain Point | What Happens |
|---|------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Lost context** | New session = start from scratch. "We discussed this yesterday" means nothing. |
| 2 | **Subagents go wild** | Parallel agents do their own thing. No coordination, duplicated work, conflicts. |
| 3 | **Scope creep** | "Add dark mode" becomes "rewrite the entire theme system." |
| 4 | **Messes to clean up** | Agent changes 47 files. Half are broken. Good luck reverting. |
| 5 | **Parallel steering impossible** | Can't guide multiple agents. They're all in their own world. |
| 6 | **No audit trail** | "What happened?" Nobody knows. Logs scattered, no unified view. |

**The ideal**: `Ticket → Hive → Iterate → Done → 3 months later → Context intact`

---

## The 7 Core Principles

### P1: Context Persists

Calibration survives between sessions. The "3 months later" problem solved.

Store grounded, project-specific knowledge:
- "We use Zustand, not Redux"
- "Auth is in `/lib/auth`, don't create new auth code"
- "We tried X, it was overkill for our scale"

**Don't store**: General knowledge the agent already has.

*Inspired by Boris's Tip 4: "Share a single CLAUDE.md file for your codebase... Whenever Claude does something incorrectly, add it so Claude learns not to repeat the mistake."*

### P2: Plan → Approve → Execute

Two phases with a clear gate between them.

| Phase | Mode | Human Role |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Planning** | Dialogue | Shape, question, refine |
| **Execution** | Trust | Agent runs, human monitors |

Planning is collaborative. Execution is autonomous. The approval gate is where trust is earned.

*Inspired by Boris's Tip 6: "Most sessions should start in Plan mode... A good plan makes all the difference."*

### P3: Human Shapes, Agent Builds

Human owns:
- The shape (what are we building?)
- The why (what problem does this solve?)
- The taste (what feels right?)

Agent owns:
- The details (how exactly to implement)
- The how (which patterns, which libraries)
- The execution (just do it)

Destination known. Path explored.

### P4: Good Enough Wins

Capture what's good enough FOR THIS CONTEXT. Reject over-engineering.

Valuable context examples:
- "We tried X, it was overkill for our 3-person team"
- "We chose Y because it was simpler, not because it's better"
- "Don't suggest Z, we explicitly rejected it"

This prevents future sessions from re-proposing rejected solutions.

### P5: Batched Parallelism

Parallel tasks grouped into batches. Sequential batches share context.

```
Batch 1 (parallel):     Batch 2 (parallel):
├── Task A              ├── Task D (uses A+B+C)
├── Task B              └── Task E (uses A+B+C)
└── Task C
        ↓
   Glue task synthesizes results
        ↓
   Context flows to Batch 2
```

This solves multi-agent coordination without complex orchestration. Each task gets a worktree. Glue tasks merge and synthesize.

*Inspired by Boris's Tip 8: "Use a few subagents regularly to automate common workflows."*

### P6: Tests Define Done

For implementation tasks, tests provide the feedback loop that dramatically improves quality.

**TDD Subtask Pattern:**
```
Task: Implement calculator
├── Subtask 1.1 [test]: Write failing tests
│   └── spec.md: Test requirements
│   └── report.md: Tests written, all failing ✓
├── Subtask 1.2 [implement]: Make tests pass
│   └── spec.md: Implementation approach
│   └── report.md: All tests passing ✓
└── Subtask 1.3 [verify]: Final verification
    └── report.md: 100% coverage, shipped ✓
```

Each subtask has its own `spec.md` (what to do) and `report.md` (what was done) — first-class audit trail.

*Inspired by Boris's Tip 13: "Give Claude a way to verify its work. When Claude has a feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result."*

### P7: Iron Laws + Hard Gates

Soft guidance fails. Agents rationalize around it. Enforce with tools, not prompts.

**Iron Laws** (~15 lines in system prompt):
```
Never:
- Plan without asking questions first
- Code without failing test first
- Complete without running verification
- Assume when uncertain - ASK

Always:
- One question at a time (discovery)
- Test → Code → Verify (TDD)
- Stop and ask when blocked
```

**Hard Gates** (tools refuse without prerequisites):
| Tool | Gate | Error |
|------|------|-------|
| `hive_plan_write` | `## Discovery` section required | "BLOCKED: Discovery required" |
| `hive_worktree_commit` | Verification keywords in summary | "BLOCKED: No verification" |

**Phase Injection** (right context at right time):
| Phase | Injection |
|-------|-----------|
| Feature create | Discovery prompt with example Q&A |
| Exec start (delegated) | Delegation protocol for Master |
| Worker spawn | TDD + Debugging protocols |

*Why this works*: Agent must consciously write `## Discovery` section. Agent must mention verification in summary. No silent bypassing.

*Inspired by Git's philosophy*: Simple primitives, hard enforcement. `git commit` refuses without staged changes. No exceptions.

---

## Subtasks: First-Class TDD Support

Subtasks enable granular tracking within a task, perfect for TDD workflows:

```
.hive/features/user-auth/tasks/01-auth-service/
├── spec.md
├── report.md
└── subtasks/
    ├── 1-write-failing-tests/
    │   ├── status.json
    │   ├── spec.md      ← Detailed test requirements
    │   └── report.md    ← What tests were written
    ├── 2-implement-auth-service/
    │   ├── status.json
    │   ├── spec.md      ← Implementation approach
    │   └── report.md    ← What was implemented
    └── 3-verify-coverage/
        ├── status.json
        └── report.md    ← Final verification results
```

**Subtask Types:**
| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `test` | Write failing tests first |
| `implement` | Make tests pass |
| `verify` | Final verification |
| `review` | Code review checkpoint |
| `research` | Investigation before coding |
| `debug` | Fix issues |
| `custom` | Anything else |

## Key Design Decisions

### No loop-until-done

Unlike Ralph Wiggum's approach (keep retrying until success), we plan first.

- Ralph: "Just keep trying until it works"
- Hive: "Plan carefully, then execute with confidence"

Different philosophy. Both valid. Hive is for when you want control over direction.

### Fix tasks, not revert commands

When something goes wrong:
- ~~Add a revert command~~ (we tried this, ended badly)
- **Spawn a fix task** (agent can git revert if they decide to)

Everything is a task. Even fixes. Keeps the model consistent.

### Blocked workers, not infinite loops

When a Forager encounters a decision it can't make:
- Worker reports `status: "blocked"` with blocker info (reason, options, recommendation)
- Swarm Bee asks user via `question()` tool — NEVER plain text
- Swarm resumes with `hive_worktree_create(continueFrom: "blocked", decision: answer)`
- New worker spawns in SAME worktree with decision context

This is different from "loop until done":
- Ralph Wiggum: Keep retrying until success
- Hive: Stop, ask, resume with clarity

Workers pause for decisions. They don't guess.

### Free-form context

Context structure is free-form. Content matters, not structure.

- Agent writes what's useful
- No forced directory structure
- No prescribed file names

Already have injection via `agents.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Hive adds feature-scoped context.

### Platform, not replacement

Hive works WITH existing tools, not instead of them.

| Existing Tool | Hive Adds |
|---------------|-----------|
| `agents.md` | Feature-scoped context |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Plan + approval workflow |
| Git branches | Worktree isolation per task |
| Todo lists | Structured task tracking with status |

---

## What Hive Is / Isn't

### Hive IS:
- A plan-first development system
- A structure for multi-agent coordination
- A context persistence layer
- A platform that enhances existing tools
- A TDD-friendly workflow with subtask tracking

### Hive IS NOT:
- A visual dashboard (Vibe Kanban does this better)
- A loop-until-done executor (Ralph Wiggum does this)
- Heavy upfront documentation (Spec Kit territory)
- An agent replacement (Oh My OpenCode territory)

---

## How Hive Differs from Alternatives

| Tool | Philosophy | Hive's Take |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **[Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)** | Spec-first, heavy upfront docs | Too heavy. Specs emerge from planning, not before. |
| **[Ralph Wiggum](https://awesomeclaude.ai/ralph-wiggum)** | Loop until done, persistence wins | Different philosophy. We plan first, not retry first. |
| **[Conductor](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor)** | Context-driven, track-based | Similar goals. We add worktree isolation + batching. |
| **[Oh My OpenCode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode)** | Agent-first, delegation model | Great complement! OMO as Hive Queen, Hive as workflow. |
| **Vibe Kanban** | Visual dashboard for agents | We're workflow, not UI. Could complement each other. |

**Hive's unique value**:
1. Batch-based parallelism with context flow (nobody else does this)
2. Worktree isolation per task (clean discard)
3. Two-phase autonomy with approval gate
4. Task-based everything (even fixes are tasks)
5. TDD subtasks with spec.md/report.md audit trail

## What We Learned From Others

Hive didn't emerge in a vacuum. We studied existing tools, took what worked, and built upon them.

### From Spec Kit (GitHub)

**What they do well:**
- Structured specifications before coding
- Clear contracts between human intent and agent execution
- Documentation as a first-class artifact

**What we learned:**
- Specs are valuable, but requiring them UPFRONT is too heavy
- Most developers won't write detailed specs before they understand the problem
- Specs should EMERGE from dialogue, not precede it

**What we built:**
- `plan.md` emerges from conversation, not a template
- `spec.md` per task captures just enough context
- No forced structure — content matters, not format

### From Conductor (Gemini CLI Extensions)

**What they do well:**
- Context-driven execution with "tracks"
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Structured workflow without being rigid

**What we learned:**
- Context persistence is essential (we agreed completely)
- Track-based organization works, but needs isolation
- Parallel execution needs coordination, not just parallelism

**What we built:**
- Feature-scoped context in `.hive/context/`
- Git worktrees for true isolation (not just logical tracks)
- Batched parallelism with context flow between batches

### From Ralph Wiggum

**What they do well:**
- Persistence wins — keep trying until success
- Automated retry loops for long-running tasks
- "Set and forget" execution model

**What we learned:**
- Loops are powerful for VERIFICATION, not planning
- Unbounded retries can waste time on wrong approaches
- Sometimes you need to stop and re-plan, not retry

**What we built:**
- TDD subtasks give feedback loops WHERE IT MATTERS (verification)
- Plan approval gate prevents wasted retries on bad plans
- Fix tasks instead of infinite loops — know when to pivot

### From Antigravity (Plan System)

**What they do well:**
- Structured planning with clear phases
- Human review gates before execution
- Task breakdown with dependencies

**What we learned:**
- Two-phase model (plan → execute) is the right abstraction
- Approval gates build trust and catch scope creep
- Dependencies between tasks need explicit handling

**What we built:**
- Plan → Approve → Execute workflow
- Batched parallelism handles dependencies naturally
- Glue tasks synthesize results between batches

### From Boris Cherny's 13 Tips

**What resonated most:**
- Tip 4: Team CLAUDE.md — shared context compounds
- Tip 6: Start in Plan mode — planning before execution
- Tip 8: Leverage subagents — parallel workers with coordination
- Tip 13: Feedback loops — 2-3x quality improvement

**What we built:**
- `.hive/context/` for feature-scoped CLAUDE.md equivalent
- Plan approval gate enforces "plan mode first"
- Batched parallelism with worktree isolation
- TDD subtasks with spec.md/report.md for feedback loops

### From Oh My OpenCode

**What they do well:**
- Agent-first architecture with specialized workers
- Delegation model — right agent for right task
- System prompt engineering for agent behavior
- Seamless integration with OpenCode ecosystem

**What we learned:**
- Specialized agents beat one-size-fits-all
- Delegation needs structure to avoid chaos
- Agent behavior is shaped by context, not just prompts
- The "Hive Queen" orchestrating workers is a powerful pattern

**What we built:**
- Hive as the WORKFLOW layer, OMO as the AGENT layer
- Feature-scoped context shapes agent behavior per-task
- Batched parallelism = structured delegation
- Perfect complement: OMO agents execute Hive tasks

---

## The Synthesis

What makes Hive unique is the COMBINATION:

| Concept | Borrowed From | Hive's Addition |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Specs | Spec Kit | Emerge from dialogue, not upfront |
| Context persistence | Conductor | Feature-scoped, not global |
| Retry loops | Ralph Wiggum | Only for verification (TDD), not planning |
| Plan gates | Antigravity | Approval before execution |
| Feedback loops | Boris Cherny | TDD subtasks with audit trail |
| Parallelism | All of them | Batched with context flow + worktree isolation |
| Agent delegation | Oh My OpenCode | Hive as workflow layer, OMO as agent layer |

**The result:** A system where humans shape direction, agents execute in isolation, context persists, and tests verify — all with full audit trail.

---

## The Mental Model

```
Feature
└── Plan (dialogue until approved)
    └── Tasks (parallel in batches)
        └── Subtasks (TDD: test → implement → verify)
            └── Worktrees (isolated execution)
                └── Reports (what was done)
                    └── Context (persists for next time)
```

Human shapes at the top. Agent builds at the bottom. Gate in the middle. Tests verify the work.
